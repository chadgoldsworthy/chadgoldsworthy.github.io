        <h1>About Me</h1>
        
        <p>
            Nationality: South African<br>
            Location: Cape Town, South Africa<br>
            Born: 1995-12-19<br><br>

            I originally studied sound engineering, and worked as a sound and lighting engineer in the 
            live events and theatre industry for a few years. I had always had a passion for technology and data, and would 
            learn programming languages in my spare time. I eventually decided to pursue a career in data engineering, so I 
            decided to study computer science and change my career path. <br><br>
            
            I graduated with a BSc Honors in Computer Science from Arden University in 2020 (graduating with 1st class), and 
            then started my masters degree in artificial intelligence with the University of Leeds in 2021. I starting working 
            for a data engineering company in 2022, and decided to not finish my masters degree as I found more value in practical 
            experience than in theoretical knowledge. I left with a postgraduate certificate (with distinction).<br><br>

            Outside of work, I am involved with an animal rescue organization, and spend my time fostering animals and helping 
            in their rehabilitation. I also enjoy hiking, and spend my weekends exploring the beautiful mountains and nature 
            reserves in Cape Town with my dogs.<br><br>

            My ultimate goal in life is to use the skills I have learned to work in the field of wildlife conservation, and to use 
            technology to help protect endangered species and their habitats. I believe that technology can play a crucial role in 
            conservation efforts, and I am passionate about using my skills to make a positive impact on the world.<br><br>
