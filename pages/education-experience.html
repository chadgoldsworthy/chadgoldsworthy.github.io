            I worked as a sound and lighting engineer in the live events and theatre industry for a few years. Initially, 
            I was involved in all aspects of live events, including setup, operation, and breakdown of sound and lighting 
            equipment. I then worked in the theatre industry, where I was responsible for the sound design and 
            operation of various productions.
